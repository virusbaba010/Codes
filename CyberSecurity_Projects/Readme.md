# 🛡️ CyberSecurity Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity tools and utilities built using Python. Each project demonstrates key concepts in ethical hacking, data encryption, keylogging, and packet analysis. These are part of my learning journey to build practical expertise in cybersecurity.

## 📂 Project Highlights

| Tool Name         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Img_Enc_Dec.py`  | Encrypts and decrypts image files using symmetric algorithms.              |
| `Text_Enc_Dec.py` | Basic text encryption and decryption using custom logic.                   |
| `Pass_Checker.py` | Checks password strength and enforces basic security rules.                |
| `Keylogger.py`    | Demonstrates a local keystroke logging mechanism for educational purposes. |
| `Packet_Analyzer.py` | Captures and analyzes network packets to understand traffic flow.         |
